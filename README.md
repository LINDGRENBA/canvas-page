#### By Brittany Lindgren

## Description

This project is an exercise in using Canvas to randomly generate animated circles on the screen. This project was built by following along with the [Animating the Canvas tutorials](https://youtu.be/EO6OkltgudE) created by Chris Courses.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* You do not need to run a server to view this document.
* No additional code is necessary to view this project.
* *WARNING*: Currently the animation is initiated by an infinite loop. This may cause problems on some systems!!!! If you are concerned about this possibility, please just enjoy the gif I've placed above in this README file. If you would still like to run this on your computer, please do so at your own risk by following the steps below.
* To clone: 
1. Copy the link from GitHub using the `Code` button
2. Open a code editor (vs code, atom, etc.)
3. Open the terminal in the editor
4. Enter the command `git clone {github-link}` in the terminal, replacing the `{github-link}` with the link you obtained in step 1.
5. Navigate into the project you just downloaded by typing `cd canvas-page` in the terminal and hitting enter.
6. Open the project by typing `code .` and hitting enter.
7. Right click on the index.html file and select `open with live browser`.
8. Open the canvas.js file, scroll to the very bottom and delete the `//` from the the line `// animate();`. This will start the animation.
9. *WARNING*: Deleting the `//` will initiate the infinite loop that is currently responsible for creating the animation. This may cause problems on some systems!!!! 
10. _Enjoy_!
